Nodes get created when a flow is deployed, they may send and receive some messages whilst the flow is running and they get deleted when the next flow is deployed.

They consist of a pair of files:

1. a JavaScript file that defines what the node does,
2. an html file that defines the nodeâ€™s properties, edit dialog and help text.
